# Spelling UIL

This is a project to help you study for Spelling UIL. It allows you to select what section you can study (or you can study all of the words at once) and randomly picks 70 words from that selection. It has two different voices that you can use to pronounce the words. To play the pronunciations, press **shift + enter** and **alt + enter**. Type in how you think it's spelled, and then press enter. It will give feedback if you get it wrong.

PSA: *All of this is for **main.py**. **Version 2.py** is if you want to take a test with just the one voice!*
